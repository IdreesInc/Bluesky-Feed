![](https://bsky.social/about/images/brand-announcement-card.png)

- A Bluesky feed algorithm intended for highlighting personal projects, open-source code, game dev, and more!
- This feed subscribes to the Bluesky firehose and filters posts that may be relevant, then applies the Hacker News algorithm to determine what's currently trending

## How to post to the feed

- ITV uses multiple metrics for determining what gets displayed to users including virality, so just posting using the filtered hashtags isn't a guarantee the feed will display your posts
- However, using the tag `#indietech` in particular will manually boost your post in the algorithm slightly and enable it to initially show up in the feed regardless of whether it has been liked yet or not
- A sample list of hashtags and keywords that ITV uses can be seen below, though this is non-exhaustive as the algorithm is always being updated better curate content and avoid spam

### Sample Keywords

```
"keywords": [
		"developers",
		"#opensource",
		"#gamedev",
		"#indiedev",
		"#webdev",
		"#programming",
		"#coding",
		"#foss",
		"3d printing",
	]
```
